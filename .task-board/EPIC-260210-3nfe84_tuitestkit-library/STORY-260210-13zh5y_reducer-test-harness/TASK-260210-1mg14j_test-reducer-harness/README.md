# TASK-260210-1mg14j: test-reducer-harness

## Description
Write tests for the harness itself using a trivial counter reducer: type CounterState struct { Count int }, actions Inc{}, Dec{}, Reset{}. Test RunReducerTests with passing/failing cases. Test RunReducerSequences with multi-step. Test InvariantChecker catches violations. Test WrapWithInvariants auto-checks on every reduce call. Verify t.Run sub-test naming. Place in reducer_test.go and invariant_test.go.
