# TASK-260210-6dozej: snapshot-diff-engine

## Description
Implement a simple unified-diff function in snapshot_diff.go: func snapshotDiff(expected, actual string) string. Line-by-line comparison showing +/- markers for added/removed lines, with context lines around changes. Output format similar to unified diff but simplified for terminal readability. No external dependency — pure string processing. This diff engine is used by all snapshot assertion functions when mismatch is detected.
