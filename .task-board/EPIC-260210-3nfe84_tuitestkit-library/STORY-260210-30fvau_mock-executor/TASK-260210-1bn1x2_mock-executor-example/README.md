# TASK-260210-1bn1x2: mock-executor-example

## Description
Create example_mock_test.go showing the full mock executor pattern end-to-end. Define a sample CLIExecutor interface, build a mock using embedded MockCallRecorder and MockResponse/MockResponseMap, wire it into a minimal bubbletea model, send messages, assert on calls. This serves as both documentation and a usage validation. Include compile-time interface check pattern.
